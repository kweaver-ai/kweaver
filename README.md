AI applications are intelligent decision programs for specific business scenarios. Based on the ADP architecture, they integrate core capabilities such as Data Agents and business knowledge networks in the business domain. Through customizable Chat and Board visualization methods, they achieve end-to-end business closed loops from inquiry, analysis, suggestion, action to feedback.

The current open-source version is the **Ontology Engine**. For documentation, please [click here](ontology/README.md).

More components will be open-sourced in the future. Stay tuned!

## Ontology Engine

The Ontology Engine is a distributed business knowledge network management system developed in Go, providing ontology modeling, data management, and intelligent query capabilities. The system adopts a microservices architecture, divided into ontology management and ontology query modules, supporting the construction, storage, and querying of large-scale knowledge networks.

### Core Features

- **Ontology Modeling & Management**: Supports definition and management of object types, relation types, and action types
- **Knowledge Network Construction**: Build multi-domain knowledge networks with complex semantic relationships
- **Intelligent Query Engine**: Provides powerful knowledge network query capabilities, supporting complex relationship queries
- **Data Integration**: Integrates multiple data sources through the VEGA virtualization engine
- **Distributed Architecture**: Microservices-based design supporting horizontal scaling
- **OpenSearch Integration**: Integrated OpenSearch for efficient search capabilities

### System Architecture

#### Module Structure

```text
kweaver/
└── ontology/
    ├── ontology-manager/     # Ontology Management Module
    └── ontology-query/       # Ontology Query Module
```

#### Ontology Manager Module

Responsible for creating, editing, and managing ontology models. Main features include:

- **Knowledge Network Management**: Build and manage business knowledge networks
- **Object Type Management**: Define and manage object types in knowledge networks
- **Relation Type Management**: Define and manage relation types in knowledge networks
- **Action Type Management**: Define executable operations and actions
- **Job Scheduling**: Background task and job management

#### Ontology Query Module

Provides efficient knowledge graph query services. Main features include:

- **Model Query**: Query and browse ontology models
- **Graph Query**: Complex relationship path queries
- **Semantic Search**: Semantic-based intelligent search
- **Data Retrieval**: Multi-dimensional data filtering and retrieval

### Quick Start

#### Prerequisites

- Go 1.23.0 or higher
- MariaDB 11.4+ or DM8 (for data storage)
- OpenSearch 2.x (for search and indexing)
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)
- Kubernetes (optional, for cluster deployment)

#### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kweaver-ai/kweaver.git
cd kweaver/ontology
```

2. **Configure environment**

Each module has its own configuration file:

- `ontology-manager/server/config/ontology-manager-config.yaml`
- `ontology-query/server/config/ontology-query-config.yaml`

3. **Run the Ontology Manager module**

```bash
cd ontology-manager/server
go mod download
go run main.go
```

The service will start at `http://localhost:13014`

4. **Run the Ontology Query module**

```bash
cd ../ontology-query/server
go mod download
go run main.go
```

The service will start at `http://localhost:13018`

#### Docker Deployment

**Build images**

```bash
# Build Ontology Manager module
cd ontology-manager
docker build -t ontology-manager:latest -f docker/Dockerfile .

# Build Ontology Query module  
cd ../ontology-query
docker build -t ontology-query:latest -f docker/Dockerfile .
```

**Run containers**

```bash
# Run Ontology Manager module
docker run -d -p 13014:13014 --name ontology-manager ontology-manager:latest

# Run Ontology Query module
docker run -d -p 13018:13018 --name ontology-query ontology-query:latest
```

#### Kubernetes Deployment

The project provides Helm charts for Kubernetes deployment:

```bash
# Deploy Ontology Manager module
helm3 install ontology-manager ontology-manager/helm/ontology-manager/

# Deploy Ontology Query module
helm3 install ontology-query ontology-query/helm/ontology-query/
```
