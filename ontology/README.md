# Ontology Engine

[中文](README.zh.md) | English

## Project Overview

The Ontology Engine is a distributed business knowledge network management system developed in Go, providing ontology modeling, data management, and intelligent query capabilities. The system adopts a microservices architecture, divided into ontology management and ontology query modules, supporting the construction, storage, and querying of large-scale knowledge networks.

### Core Features

- **Ontology Modeling & Management**: Supports definition and management of object types, relation types, and action types
- **Knowledge Network Construction**: Build multi-domain knowledge networks with complex semantic relationships
- **Intelligent Query Engine**: Provides powerful knowledge network query capabilities, supporting complex relationship queries
- **Data Integration**: Integrates multiple data sources through the VEGA virtualization engine
- **Distributed Architecture**: Microservices-based design supporting horizontal scaling
- **OpenSearch Integration**: Integrated OpenSearch for efficient search capabilities

```

### Ontology Manager Module (ontology-manager)

Responsible for creating, editing, and managing ontology models. Main features include:

- **Knowledge Network Management**: Build and manage business knowledge networks
- **Object Type Management**: Define and manage object types in knowledge networks
- **Relation Type Management**: Define and manage relation types in knowledge networks
- **Action Type Management**: Define executable operations and actions
- **Job Scheduling**: Background task and job management

### Ontology Query Module (ontology-query)

Provides efficient knowledge graph query services. Main features include:

- **Model Query**: Query and browse ontology models
- **Graph Query**: Complex relationship path queries
- **Semantic Search**: Semantic-based intelligent search
- **Data Retrieval**: Multi-dimensional data filtering and retrieval

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.23.0 or higher
- MariaDB 11.4+ or DM8 (for data storage)
- OpenSearch 2.x (for search and indexing)
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)
- Kubernetes (optional, for cluster deployment)

### Local Development

#### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kweaver-ai/kweaver.git
cd kweaver/ontology
```

#### 2. Configure environment

Each module has its own configuration file:

- `ontology-manager/server/config/ontology-manager-config.yaml`
- `ontology-query/server/config/ontology-query-config.yaml`

#### 3. Run the Ontology Manager module

```bash
cd ontology-manager/server
go mod download
go run main.go
```

The service will start at `http://localhost:13014`

#### 4. Run the Ontology Query module

```bash
cd ../ontology-query/server
go mod download
go run main.go
```

The service will start at `http://localhost:13018`

### Docker Deployment

#### Build images

```bash
# Build Ontology Manager module
cd ontology-manager
docker build -t ontology-manager:latest -f docker/Dockerfile .

# Build Ontology Query module  
cd ../ontology-query
docker build -t ontology-query:latest -f docker/Dockerfile .
```

#### Run containers

```bash
# Run Ontology Manager module
docker run -d -p 13014:13014 --name ontology-manager ontology-manager:latest

# Run Ontology Query module
docker run -d -p 13018:13018 --name ontology-query ontology-query:latest
```

### Kubernetes Deployment

The project provides Helm charts for Kubernetes deployment:

```bash
# Deploy Ontology Manager module
helm3 install ontology-manager ontology-manager/helm/ontology-manager/

# Deploy Ontology Query module
helm3 install ontology-query ontology-query/helm/ontology-query/
```
